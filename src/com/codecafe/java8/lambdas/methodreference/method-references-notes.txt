 Method References
-------------------

The sole purpose of Method Reference is to simplify the implementation of Functional Interface.

But we already did that by using Lambdas !

Lambdas helped us to move away from creating Anonymous Inner Classes.

Now Method References are used to simplify the Lambda Expression itself.

It is also known as a Shortcut for writing Lambda Expressions.

From its name it is clear that it is used to refer a method in a class.


Syntax :

Instance::methodName
ClassName::instance-methodName
ClassName::static-methodName
ClassName::new


Where to use Method Reference ?

 When we are taking an input in a Lambda Expression and directly passing it to a method without doing anything else on the input parameter.


 Example :

 Using Lambda :

     Function<String, String> toUpperCaseLambda = (s) -> s.toUpperCase();
    
 Using Method Reference :

     Function<String, String> toUpperCaseLambda = String::toUpperCase;
