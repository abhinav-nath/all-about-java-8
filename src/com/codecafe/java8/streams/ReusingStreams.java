    // To overcome this limitation we have to to create a new stream chain for every terminal operation we want to execute,
    // e.g. we could create a stream supplier to construct a new stream with all intermediate operations already set up:

    Supplier<Stream<String>> streamSupplier = () -> Stream.of("d2", "a2", "b1", "b3", "c")
                                                          .filter(s -> s.startsWith("a"));

    streamSupplier.get().anyMatch(s -> true);   // ok
    streamSupplier.get().noneMatch(s -> true);  // ok

    // Each call to get() constructs a new stream on which we are save to call the desired terminal operation.
