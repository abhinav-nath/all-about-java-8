     * The lambda expressions make the code concise, but quietly lead to duplicate
     * code. In the previous example, one change to the lambda expression needs to
     * change in more than one place - that's a no-no. Fortunately, we can assign
     * lambda expressions to variables and reuse them, just like with objects.
     *
     * The filter() method, the receiver of the lambda expression in the previous
     * example, takes a reference to a java.util.function.Predicate functional
     * interface. Here, the Java compiler works its magic to synthesize an
     * implementation of the Predicate's test() method from the given lambda
     * expression. Rather than asking Java to synthesize the method at the
     * argument-definition location, we can be more explicit.
     *
     * In this example, it's possible to store the lambda expression in an explicit
     * reference of type Predicate and then pass it to the function; this is an easy
     * way to remove the duplication. Let's refactor the previous code to make it
     * DRY.

     * expression stored in the variable under the guise of the Predicate instance.
