 Pure Functions
----------------

goto is to structured programming
as assignment is to functional programming


Pure Function:

    Returns the same result for the same input, no many how many times you call it.

    Has no side-effects
    
Two rules of purity:

    1. The function does not change anything
    2. The function does not depend on anything that may possibly change

A pure functions sees no evil and does no evil !
